Hi There !!

In this project you will get to know how to configure OAuth(Open Authentication) Client and OAuth Login using Spring. We have added 2 major dependecies:

1. OAuth Client(Which already have Spring-Security)
2. Spring Web(For making a dummy home controller)

Here we are using GitHub to verify the user. For this we need Github Client Id and Client Secret. 
In GitHub you can go under Setting> Developer Setting> Create OAuth application and fill teh required details.

We can also use Google as a OAuth Client. Hope you will find it easy and interesting!!

Cheers!
